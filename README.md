# Image Processing

This repository contains hands-on assignments covering key concepts in image processing. Throughout these assignments, we explore fundamental techniques and their practical applications, from basic transformations to advanced enhancements.  

- **Sampling & Quantization** – Understanding Nyquist's theorem, histograms, and quantization methods.  
- **Point & Geometric Operations** – Applying intensity transformations and spatial adjustments.  
- **Spatial Filters & Image Enhancement** – Using bilateral filtering and fixing image distortions.  
- **Fourier Transform & Image Restoration** – Frequency domain analysis for scaling, cleaning, and restoring images.  
- **Template Matching & Blending** – Implementing feature detection, multiband blending, and object matching.
